java-datastructures
===================

This repository contains
- Alternate implementations of some Java Collections
- New Collection classes

This is not meant for high-performance usage. It is merely my attempt at OO-based implementation of the data structures.

Done so far:
- Linked List, Stack, Deque (without indexing, search)
- Set (using the BitSet for contains() method)
- MultiSet (exhaustive implementation, API similar to Google Guava Multiset)
